Implications of acquired cancer-related mutations inpluripotent and differentiated cells

A repository of the analysis and presentation of cancer-related mutations during differentiation.


## Abstract
We have analyzed over 2,200 published transcriptomes from differentiation experiments of human pluripotent stem cells, identifying prevalent acquisition and expansion of cancerous mutations in vitro. TP53 mutations confer a selective advantage in culture and induce aberrant molecular phenotypes in TP53-targets and in the regulation of cell-fate transition. 
These findings have significant implications on the need for surveillance of cancer-related mutations especially in clinical applications.
